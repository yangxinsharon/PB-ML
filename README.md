# PB-ML
Poisson-Boltzmann Machine Learning
No. 364 model was trained based on 427 features.
The python script "feature.py" generates the graph features, VDW and Coulomb force features.
The python script "generate_feature.py" generates and fetches all 427 features.
The python script "run364.py" generate test data using the above scripts and call the saved model for prediction.
